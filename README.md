#Theory
Force is pull or thrust
Force have three law called Newton Law's, there are:
1) The first's law:
"Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it."
2) The second law:
"The relationship between an object's mass m, its acceleration a, and the applied force F is F = ma. Acceleration and force are vectors (as indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector"
3) The thirth law:
"If the first object of the work force a second object, the second object will work on the style of the first things the same magnitude, but opposite direction"
